Suggestions for possible UI approvements:
	
	- All mandatory fields marked with '*'
	
	- Button submit is in inactive state unitl all mandatory fields provided with valid data

	- When invalid data provided to the field, human readable error message appears (in terms to help user understand what went wrong )

	- Fields Age and Salary block any inputs except positive int (for field Salary which could be float '.' or ',' symbols allowed)

	- Fileds First/Last Name blocks any inputs except letters, spaces, '.', '-' and (') symbols

	- If any data was provided to the fields, when "X" is clicked to leave the form without save -> comfirmation pop-up appears (if user clicks "NO" in confirmation popup, he is redirected back to the form, all the previously provided data remains in the fields )
